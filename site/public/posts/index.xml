      <description>Comal Crackers
Comal is type of griddle/ round flat pan to heat up / cook certain types of things over a stove instead of oven.
Originally I was making coconut crepes and another gluten free vegan crepe batter that is from my upbringing, then it lead to me experimenting to see what I can do with the batter instead of using loads more oil ( i was able to use a stainless steel pot to prepare the crÃªpes instead of a nonstick pan using a method with oil to make a stainless steel pot nonstick,that led to the crepes frying instead of cooking the way its supposed to, but it was crispy and yummy like I like it but too oily for me.</description>
