      <description>Comal Crackers
Comal is type of griddle/ round flat pan to heat up / cook certain types of things over a stove instead of oven.
Originally I was making coconut crepes and another gluten free vegan crepe batter that is from my upbringing, then it lead to me experimenting to see what I can do with the batter instead of using loads more oil ( i was able to use a stainless steel pot to prepare the crêpes instead of a nonstick pan using a method with oil to make a stainless steel pot nonstick,that led to the crepes frying instead of cooking the way its supposed to, but it was crispy and yummy like I like it but too oily for me.</description>

In 1958, designers at the Illinois Institute of Technology said that the Chemex Coffeemaker is &amp;ldquo;one of the best-designed products of modern times&amp;rdquo;, and so is included in the collection of the Museum of Modern Art in New York City.</description>

      <title>Making sense of the SCAA’s new Flavor Wheel</title>
      <link>https://hungerunited.com/post/making-sense/</link>

      <description>The SCAA updated the wheel to reflect the finer nuances needed to describe flavors more precisely. The new descriptions are more detailed and hence allow cuppers to distinguish between more flavors.
While this is going to be a big change for professional coffee tasters, it means a lot to you as a consumer as well. We’ll explain how the wheel came to be, how pros use it and what the flavors actually mean.</description>
