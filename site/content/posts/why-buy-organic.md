There is usually a greater variety of beneficial bacteria population that are naturally found in abundance
typically on organic instead of conventional produce, that you need and want to proliferate in fermenting
your vegetables.
Organic produce are also found to have higher level of antioxidants than conventional grown produce.

\-I do my best to purchase certified gluten free, & organic foods whenever possible.
I don't go overboard, but I do make sure anything on the EWG dirty dozen list is purchased organic.
Benefits of fermented foods
“Compounds known as biologically active peptides, which are produced by the bacteria responsible for
fermentation, are also well known for their health benefits. Among these peptides, conjugated linoleic
acids (CLA) have a blood pressure lowering effect, exopolysaccharides exhibit prebiotic properties,
bacteriocins show anti-microbial effects, sphingolipids have anti-carcinogenic and anti-microbial
properties, and bioactive peptides exhibit anti-oxidant, anti-microbial, opioid antagonist, anti-allergenic,
and blood pressure lowering effects. As a result, fermented foods provide many health benefits such as
anti-oxidant, anti-microbial, anti-fungal, anti-inflammatory, anti-diabetic and anti-atherosclerotic activity.

How to Avoid Plastic or Styrofoam when ordering
food to go/take out/ or eating out?

\-On the rare occasions I eat out I'll place any leftovers in my glass or stainless steel container(s) that I
bring with me , or when I go to pick up my food, I will call ahead of time to see if they will allow me to
transfer my food to my own containers so there is less take out/carry out packaging.
It is rare I'll go to a restaurant that uses styrofoam or plastic containers.
-I would rather go to a business that uses ecofriendly containers.

\-I use a bamboo toothbrush and make my own tooth power that leaves an all day dentist clean smooth
feeling on my teeth even after meals using just organic Ceylon cinnamon, calcium carbonate, occasional
activated charcoal, & aluminum- free baking soda,...
-For a couple years since I stopped using conventional toothpaste I have no cavities, except for a teeny
tiny external one that was filled at a holistic dentist
vs

other people that use toothpaste and still get cavities and have no medical condition , or those that are
unfortunate to rely on pharmaceutical medications that reduces their saliva production ...

\-Reduce, reuse, recycle
Why Recycling is not the answer, how to recycle
Did you know recycling is not the best solution and ought to be the last option, and reducing and reusing
what we have ought to be the 1st priority and steps to reduce how much waste we produce.
The throw-away consumer habits and “ fast convenience” over sustainably has distorted that order.
Recycling still requires energy , can be contaminated with other non recyclable items due to non-standard
recycling guidelines and careless individuals that are on autopilot and chooses not to place their trash in
the respective container even if it’s right next to the recycling bin,
and not everything that goes to the recycling bin gets recycled locally or even properly unfortunately.
I invite you to consider reducing your usage of plastic significantly if you do not already, and utilize
reusable items 1st and foremost to reduce the amount of trash that ends up in landfills, or being
incinerated.
-Terracycle.com is a great website and company for hard to recycle items since we cannot avoid plastic
completely yet.

\-When we take care of our body well it will take care of us well, such
consuming whole fresh plant based foods &/or appropriate medicinal products grown organically
&/or in a regenerative manner with synergistic properties that’s been used for thousands of years,
as much as possible,
will be more beneficial than the push for product(s) with questionable ingredients.
-I trust my body created by the Divine, & its innate wisdom to heal,
detox,
regenerate when we nourish it with what’s available from the 1st scientist & artist Mother Earth , than
what humans try to mimic that Gaia has perfected over thousands of years, not mere months for profit &
other more malevolent means.
-I invite & encourage you to vote more with your lifestyle choices ,
your money...support people local to you,
not any inhumane,...name brands, group(s),
organization(s), media, ...that don’t see you as a person, & instead more of something to exploit for
profit.

\-I do my best to live more simply (minimalism, eliminating a lot of distractions,...), be more in Mother
Nature, be more present in life...

As of now, I mainly consuming whole plant-based foods: vegan (I don't like labels, but for simplicity )
from learning more & optimizing my health,
along with ethical, environmental, ...
spiritual reasons.
I do my best to not consume the common allergens (there may be accidental exposure) of:
dairy,
eggs,
soy,
corn,
peanuts,
wheat & a majority of grains (especially since there's can be cross contamination of gluten),
added sugars,
Fake meat,...

There's no way for something to be purely vegan unless I am dining at an all vegan place.
So I don't make a fuss over it because I appreciate it when others accommodate my dietary choices , and
are open to consuming more plant based foods.

\-I pick up trash/rubbish in whenever I see trash or rubbish on the ground or on plants (however you
choose to look at it, single use plastic bags do get tangled up in the branches , or will break down into tiny
pieces and end up in waterways, in the stomach of animals that accidentally ingest it.
The trees, shrubs,& wind, possibly have the bag get caught in the plants so hopefully some conscious
mobile beings like myself and other caring conscious beings will see it and pull it out and recycle it if it’s
clean and dry, or throw it in the trash so it doesn’t end up in the bodies of water, soil, air.
-I pick up rubbish/trash especially if I can locate a rubbish/trash can or recycling bin nearby, in my daily
life, and when I travel.
It’s my way of giving back and showing my gratitude to everything internal and external to me...for
making it possible for me to be able to travel & be to many places around the world;
the opportunities & greater possibilities in my life;
and having countless enjoyable priceless experiences , & valuable people in my life
despite the few very unfortunate events I dealt with.

\-I keep people, animals, & our home planet in mind in how I choose to live my life, and my consumer

choices especially, when our consumer choices can have detrimental impacts on those with more social-
economic barriers or other unfortunate life factors such as

human trafficking,
& /or sexuality, mentally, emotionally, financially, physically abused victims, that don’t have a voice or
could be negatively affected by our by our lifestyle choices and purchases, if we don't make the effort to
be conscious informed consumers.

I invite you to continue to question what conventional mainstream knowledge and information says and
even the beliefs you have been told to believe if you don’t already,...including researching into learning
more about medicinal plants, other healing modalities, other more synergistic, natural , alternatives to
optimizing your health, ...which I’m sure there’s a higher # people on this network/website/community is
already, which I am super grateful more people are taking back their power, awareness, ...making
informed choices instead of just following blindly with questions an authority figure that may have years
of medical training that I don’t discount, but to keep in mind they are trained on more of learning about
pathology, not about preventative measures & optimization one’s health through non invasive &/or non
synthetic pharmaceutical approaches, unless they are a functional medicine practitioner, or other holistic
healthcare professionals.
Scientific research has its merits and place, but I see it’s ideal to combine the applications of eastern
holistic medicine’s whole mind-body approach with western medicine’s imaging and technology.
Acute emergency issues are best treated with western modern medicine, but not so much chronic health
challenges.
Of course not everyone has embraced or yet to be aware of how amazing our bodies can self heal chronic
issues especially, when we do what works best for our mind, body, & spirit with:
-whatever information or teachings that empowers and inspires us,

* having gratitude & cultivating forgiveness...
  -nourishing our body with :
  healthy whole minimally processed foods,
  Nature,
  self care,
  nurturing touch, ...;
  -Removing or reduce /limiting exposure to:
  toxins
  toxic thought patterns , toxic situations ,
  toxic individuals,
  as much as possible...
